# deeplearning-keras-implementations

This repository contains some deeplearning model implementations I have done using Keras and Tensorflow as backend

1. Densenet: 'Densely Connected Convolutional Neural Networks' by Liu et al.
2. Resnet: 'Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition' by He et al. for the CIFAR-10 dataset
3. ResneXt: 'Aggregated Residual Transformations for Deep Neural Networks' by Xie et al. for the CIFAR-10 dataset
